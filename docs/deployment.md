# Deploying the backend

Every push to `main` goes live on the production server (`/var/www/backend`, PM2 app `backend`) a minute or two later. There's no `git pull` on the server any more.

## What a push does

1. **Check.** GitHub Actions ([.github/workflows/deploy.yml](../.github/workflows/deploy.yml)) installs the packages and runs `npm run lint`. A lint error stops here: nothing reaches the server.
2. **Deploy.** Actions connects to the server over SSH with a deploy key that can only run [scripts/deploy.sh](../scripts/deploy.sh). The script:
   - stops, changing nothing, if files on the server differ from git or the push adds database migrations (see below);
   - moves the checkout forward to the pushed commit;
   - runs `npm install --omit=dev` if `package.json` or `package-lock.json` changed;
   - restarts the app with `pm2 restart backend`, unless only docs, migrations or deploy files changed;
   - waits up to a minute for `GET /api/healthcheck`. If the app doesn't answer, it puts the previous commit back, restarts that, and fails the run.

The run's log in the repository's **Actions** tab says which of these happened. The restart takes the API down for a few seconds, as the manual deploys did. A push made during a deploy waits for it.

A deploy never touches `.env`. When new code needs a new `.env` value, add it on the server before pushing: if a required one is missing the app won't start, and the deploy rolls back.

## When a deploy stops

| The run says | What to do |
|---|---|
| Lint failed | Fix the error and push again. |
| "files on the server differ from git" | Someone edited or uploaded a file on the server. Commit that change from your machine, or discard it on the server (`git checkout -- <file>`). Then **Actions → Deploy → Run workflow**. |
| "adds or changes the database migrations" | Back up, then run the `before deploy` migrations by hand ([migrations/README.md](../migrations/README.md)). Then **Actions → Deploy → Run workflow** with **migrations done** ticked. Run any `after deploy` migrations once it's live. Until then, every later push stops the same way. |
| "npm install failed" | The code is back on the previous commit and the app wasn't restarted. Fix `package.json` or the lockfile and push again. If it adds "don't restart it", run `npm install --omit=dev` in `/var/www/backend` first. |
| "failed and was rolled back" | The new code didn't start; the site runs the previous commit. `pm2 logs backend` on the server shows why. Fix and push again. |
| "doesn't answer after going back" | The site is down. Check `pm2 logs backend` on the server now. |

## Undoing a release

`git revert <commit>` and push. The server only moves forward along `main`: don't force-push it, the deploy refuses a commit that doesn't build on the one running.

## Known lint errors

[eslint-suppressions.json](../eslint-suppressions.json) lists 4 errors that were already in the code when the pipeline started, so that lint can still block new ones:

- `Op` is not defined in [checkout.service.js](../src/services/Common/checkout.service.js), in the admin payment list's search.
- `Payment` is not defined in [order.service.js](../src/services/Common/order.service.js), when an order is cancelled.

Both throw when that code runs. When you fix one, run `npx eslint . --prune-suppressions` and commit the updated file in the same commit; lint fails while the file lists errors that are gone.

## Setup

Done once, on 30 October 2026:

- **Server:** `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys` holds the deploy key, limited to the script:
  `command="/bin/bash /var/www/backend/scripts/deploy.sh",restrict ssh-ed25519 AAAA… github-actions-deploy`
- **GitHub:** the repository's Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions has:
  - `DEPLOY_HOST`: the server's IP address.
  - `DEPLOY_SSH_KEY`: the deploy key's private key.
- **Workflow:** `HOST_KEY` in [deploy.yml](../.github/workflows/deploy.yml) is the server's public host key (`/etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key.pub`), so the deploy refuses to talk to any other machine. If the server is rebuilt or moved, update it there.

To replace the key, make a new one (`ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -N "" -C github-actions-deploy -f deploy_key`), swap the line in `authorized_keys`, and paste the new private key into `DEPLOY_SSH_KEY`.

Don't edit files on the server, including through an editor's SFTP "upload on save": the next deploy stops until those changes are committed or discarded.
